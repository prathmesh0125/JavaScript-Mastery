<!-- **intro to variables -->
variable can store some information
we can use or change that information later

ex:var firstname ="parthmesh";

only use var when declare varible firstime letter we don't need it  ex: firstname ="ritesh"; 
or we use it var firstname ="parthmesh";

Rules for nameing varibles 
1.You can't start with number
2.you can only use dollar and _ symbol
3.you cannot use spaces
convetion
start with small letter ans use camelcases
when we use underscore betwen varible this is called snake case writting

<!-- Let vs var vs const-->
1.in var we can declare two varible with same name but in let we can't do that
2. var introduce from starting of the javascript but let and const introduce in ES6
3.we can chagevthe value of let and var .but we can;t change the value of const
4.var is function based || let is brases based;
5.var adds it self to window object ||  let doesn't add into window object

<!-- string  -->
 string indexing

let firstName="prathmesh";
console.log(firstName[0]);
console.log(firstName.length-1)//it include spaces also
console.log(firstName[firstName.length-1])//finding last character

Note:String is immutable so we have to store there  ans into another variable
